<p>Now for the nitty gritty. Here are tools you can use every day to improve your 
learning. These ideas are drawn from <em>Ultralearning</em> and <em>Make It Stick</em>.</p>
<p>These are all applications of techniques discussed in <em>Make It Stick</em>. I'll list
 the technique name after each and I'll cover the actual techniques themselves 
 in detail later, but here's what you can do if you want to get started right now.</p>
<p>For each topic you're trying to learn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test yourself with quizzes in the back of the book. (testing, recall)</li>
<li>Look at a concept, define it, and use it in a paragraph. (recall, elaboration)</li>
<li>While reading, convert the main points of the text into a series of
questions and then later try to answer them. (testing, elaboration)</li>
<li>Rephrase the main ideas in your own words as you read. (elaboration, recall)</li>
<li>Try to relate them to what he already know. (elaboration)</li>
<li>Look for examples outside of the text. (elaboration)</li>
</ol>
<p>From various sources, I've created the following tool for helping to learn 
materials. I call it <strong>Explain to Understand</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Explain to Understand</strong><br>After reading a section in a book, if you donʼt understand:        </p>
<ul>
<li>Explain each sentence. You can speak it or type it, but you need to get the 
information out of your head. Forcing yourself to do so will reveal what you 
do and don't really understand. Don't move on from each sentence until you 
can do so.        </li>
</ul>
<p>If you do understand:        </p>
<ul>
<li>Close the book and recall everything you can remember about its main points, 
then go back and fill in the points you didn’t understand 
(forgetting is a sign of not understanding).        </li>
<li>Play devil’s advocate and try to poke holes in the argument. Alternatively, 
try to prove the argument correct.    </li>
<li>Try to create a visualization or analogy.        </li>
<li>Teach the concept to someone else.</li>
</ul>
