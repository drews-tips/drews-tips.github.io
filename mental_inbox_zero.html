<h1 id="mental-inbox-zero">Mental Inbox Zero</h1>
<p>David Allen's <span><em>Getting Things Done</em></span> is a very famous productivity book. It taught me a number
of things, and only one of them is about productivity.</p>
<p>At first glance, it has all the trappings of a normal self-help book: charts,
a solution to a nagging problem you've had, glowing recommendations from
luminaries in the productivity field. But I always had one big problem with the
author's system. It's just too complicated.</p>
<p>The first time I laid eyes on that flow chart, I knew that I wouldn't be able to
do anything with the book. How could something intended to simplify make things
so much more complex? Would I really need to go through that decision matrix
every time I needed to accomplish something? No thanks.</p>
<p>Instead, I learned two things from the book: one the author meant to convey and
one he didn't.</p>
<h3 id="1-for-a-book-to-be-good-and-worth-recommending-it-needs-to-affect-my-life-in-only-one-way">1. For a book to be "good" and worth recommending, it needs to affect my life in only one way.</h3>
<p>It's not that I lowered my standards. It's just that life is complicated and
full of tons of things to do and learn, so I set the bar really low. Like,
read-a-200-page-book-and-only-take-1-thing-from-it-low.</p>
<p>Making the standard receiving <em>any</em> life improvement from a book changed how I
evaluate them.</p>
<h3 id="2-get-things-off-your-plate-as-soon-as-possible">2. Get things off your plate as soon as possible.</h3>
<p>That was so huge for me that when I first dug into the book in 2011, it
immediately changed how I lived. To paraphrase the author, if a task comes across
your plate and you can knock it out in under 2 minutes, just do it.</p>
<p>I combine this with Cal Newport's
<span><em>How To Become a Straight-A Student</em></span>'s idea of scheduling
everything to free my mind from tasks that take longer than 2 minutes. If it
doesn't get scheduled, it's not getting done.</p>
<p>Huge.</p>
<p>I didn't believe it at first, but the secondary effect of removing these
nuisances is that you never have to keep anything in your head. Nothing
burdens your working memory. It's free to think about the next big, exciting
thing instead of trying to remember that you've got an appointment in a few
hours.</p>
<p>I call this "mental inbox zero," and I make use of it all the time to increase
my focus. For example, I was working earlier, and I was in the middle of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro</a>. Those 25 minutes
are sacred. But, I had another thought come up that was distracting me, so I
popped open a sticky note on my Mac and wrote it down. That freed my mind to
focus more. Similarly, I keep bookmarks of different notepads on my browser,
just one click away, so that I can dump ideas into them without having to be
distracted when I'm in the middle of working.</p>
<p>Another example in a Pomodoro: I had to drop my car off at the shop today
(darn "check engine" light), and I was pretty sure that I had to be there at
12:30... or was it 11:30? 1:30? I couldn't remember, and it was distracting to
try and remember while I was working. Remembering the 2-minute rule, I checked
my calendar, saw that the appointment was for 12:30, and set a timer on my phone
to go off 30 minutes beforehand. I no longer needed to think about anything
except my work. My mind was free to dive back into productivity.</p>
<p>One of my favorite Cal Newport thoughts is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High-Quality Work Produced = Time Spent x Intensity of Focus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to keep the intensity of my focus until my Pomodoro timer goes off.
It's just 25 minutes, and I want to make the most of it.</p>
