<p>How Do You Learn Something Really Big? (Part 1)</p>
<p>Some of my learning projects have taken years to complete like getting accepted to CIM’s DMA program, passing my doctoral qualifying exams, learning to code, and skilling up enough as a software developer to get hired at Facebook.</p>
<p>Whenever I decide that I want to learn something, I get out the same resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, Mark A. McDaniel</li>
<li>59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot by Richard Wiseman</li>
<li>Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career by Scott Young</li>
</ul>
<p>I start with Ultralearning. I love the steps the author lays out, and I adjust them to suit my needs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather Your Materials<ul>
<li>Define what counts as “learned” -- Reading a book is not learning; it’s exposure. It’s the first of many steps to actually learning, but it’s only the first step. I define what I should be able to do upon completion of my learning project. “Be able to solve a Cracking The Coding Interview problem in under 30 minutes” is much better than “Finish reading the book.”</li>
<li>Gather the learning materials -- Have them all accessible and ready to go.</li>
<li>Research how others have learned it -- Ask 10 people you respect how they learned it and copy the most-common techniques. Sometimes it can be tough to find enough people. That's ok. Then you'll need to lean on feedback or results. Commit to trying a technique for a week, then evaluate at the end. Keep iterating until you've found something that works.</li>
<li>Beware of false idols -- As stated above, reading is not the end, it's just the beginning. The same goes for online classes and tutorials. Having completed one or many of them is not enough. It's just the first step.</li>
<li>Real-life practice -- You’ve got to simulate the final environment, even if it’s only a portion of the final situation. Preparing for technical coding interviews is tough. But you've got to simulate the situation. Get a mock interview, or set a timer for 20 minutes and flip to a random interview problem. Do some jumping jacks to make sure you're heart rate is a little up. Make things as real as possible.</li>
<li>Schedule Your Time -- If this is your top priority, it goes into your schedule first. And, it has to be sustainable. What’s sustainable over a year (or three)? 5 hours/day? 6 hours every weekend? Getting up at 3am? Nope. How about 45 minutes/day 5 days/week with unlimited forgiveness if something comes up? That’s always worked for me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set Yourself Up for Success<ul>
<li>Cal Newport says: High-Quality Work Produced = Time Spent x Intensity of Focus. Put the phone in another room, eliminate all distractions, and work in silence.</li>
<li>Simulate the final situation at least once a week.</li>
<li>Find your weaknesses and attack them. Having a hard time understanding recursion? Doing more problems in the medium-difficulty category will help you wrap your head around it.</li>
<li>The best form of practice is recall. You need to know that what you’ve practiced or studied is going to be there when you need it to be. The only way to make sure something is there under pressure is to put yourself under pressure and check. Just don’t wait until showtime, or it’ll be too late.</li>
<li>As we like to say at Facebook, feedback is a gift. Get as much of it from reliable sources as possible.</li>
<li>Be flexible -- Bruce Lee said to be like water. Things are going to happen. You're going to uncover weaknesses you didn't know you had. Allow yourself time to adjust your schedule for them.</li>
<li>Never cram -- Information gained easily is lost easily</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Worksheet</p>
<ol>
<li>What's your goal?</li>
<li>What materials are you going to use to achieve that goal?</li>
<li>How have others achieved this goal?</li>
<li>How best can you simulate part (or all) of what you want to be able to do?</li>
<li>How much time and how often are you going to work on achieving this goal?</li>
<li>How will you receive feedback?</li>
<li>How will you incorporate feedback into your work?</li>
</ol>
