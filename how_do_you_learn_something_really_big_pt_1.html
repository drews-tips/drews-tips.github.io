<p>How Do You Learn Something Really Big? (Part 1)</p>
<p>Some of my learning projects have taken years to complete like getting accepted to CIM’s DMA program, passing my doctoral qualifying exams, learning to code, and skilling up enough as a software developer to get hired at Facebook.</p>
<p>Whenever I decide that I want to learn something, I get out the same learning resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, Mark A. McDaniel</li>
<li>59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot by Richard Wiseman</li>
<li>Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career by Scott Young</li>
</ul>
<p>I start with Ultralearning. I love the steps the author lays out, and I adjust them to suit my needs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather Your Materials<ul>
<li>Define what counts as “learned” -- Reading a book is not learning; it’s exposure. It’s the first of many steps to actually learning, but it’s only the very first step. I define what I should be able to do upon completion of my learning project. “Be able to solve a Cracking The Coding Interview problem in under 30 minutes” is much better than “Finish reading the book.” Reading the chapter is important, but it’s only the beginning.</li>
<li>Gather the learning materials -- Nothing derails a learning plan like waiting for a book to arrive from Amazon.</li>
<li>Research how others have learned the skill -- With something like music, this is easy. Techniques, guides, and teachers have been around forever. With coding, it’s a lot tougher. There are online classes, but those, again, are only the beginning.</li>
<li>Real-life practice -- You’ve got to simulate the final environment, even if it’s only a portion of the final situation. You don’t need to practice the clarinet in a tuxedo, but you better be comfortable with the final tempo eventually.</li>
<li>Schedule Your Time -- Essentially pay yourself first. If this is your top priority, it goes into your schedule first. And, it has to be sustainable. What’s sustainable over a year (or three)? 5 hours/day? 6 hours every weekend? Getting up at 3am? How about 45 minutes/day 5 days/week with unlimited forgiveness if something comes up? That’s always worked for me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set Yourself Up for Success<ul>
<li>Cal Newport says: High-Quality Work Produced = Time Spent x Intensity of Focus. Put the phone in another room, eliminate all distractions, work in silence.</li>
<li>Simulate the final situation at least once a week. Run-throughs are good on the clarinet, and mock interviews will get you comfortable with technical coding under pressure.</li>
<li>Find your weaknesses and attack them. Is that piece in E Major? You better have that scale and arpeggio ready to go. Difficulty with recursion? Doing more problems in the medium will help you wrap your head around it.</li>
<li>The best form of practice is recall. You need to know that what you’ve practiced or studied is going to be there when you need it to be. The only way to make sure something is there under pressure is to put yourself under pressure and check. Just don’t wait until showtime, or it’ll be too late.</li>
<li>As we like to say at Facebook, feedback is a gift. Get as much of it from reliable sources as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Worksheet</p>
<ol>
<li>What's your goal?</li>
<li>What materials are you going to use to achieve that goal?</li>
<li>How have others achieved this goal?</li>
<li>How best can you simulate part (or all) of what you want to be able to do?</li>
<li>How much time and how often are you going to work on achieving this goal?</li>
<li>How will you receive feedback?</li>
<li>How will you incorporate feedback into your work?</li>
</ol>
