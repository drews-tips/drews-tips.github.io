<p>You don't always gets to choose what you get to work on, and sometimes those
things stink. In music, you'll be given pieces that are incredibly tough that
no one wants to listen to. In tech, you'll be asked to fix some crazy bug that
you'd rather just let stay in the code. In school, you're going to have to write
papers and research topics you have zero interest in. It will happen.</p>
<p>So, what do you do? </p>
<p>Here are a few suggestions that have worked for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Schedule the time you're going to force yourself to do it</li>
<li>Make it as easy as possible to get started</li>
<li>Commit to just 5 minutes (but do a lot of them!)</li>
<li>Start as early as possible</li>
<li>Make a tiny habit out of just starting</li>
<li>Be kind to yourself</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Schedule the time you're going to force yourself to do it</strong></p>
<p>When I was auditioning around as a clarinetist, there were tons of times when I
didn't want to practice. I was exhausted most of the time anyway, and getting up
and driving all the way down to the studio never sounded appetizing. But, I
practiced at 6:30. That's what I'd been doing for years, and I had all that
momentum behind me, so it became easy to drag myself down there.</p>
<p>This is similar to a story of Jerry Seinfeld's that Cal Newport recounts in his
book, <em>Deep Work</em>: "Seinfeld began his advice to Isaac with some common sense,
noting “the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes,” and then
explaining that the way to create better jokes was to write every day. Seinfeld
continued by describing a specific technique he used to help maintain this
discipline. He keeps a calendar on his wall. Every day that he writes jokes he
crosses out the date on the calendar with a big red X. “After a few days you’ll
have a chain,” Seinfeld said. “Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer
every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks
under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.” I didn't know it
at the time, but I had a chain, and I wasn't going to break it.</p>
<p><strong>Make it as easy as possible to get started</strong></p>
<p>In <em>The Happiness Advantage</em>, by Shawn Achor, the author refers to the will to just
get started as "activation energy." If you can reduce the amount of activation
energy required to begin, starting won't be so bad. When I was studying for
technical interviews, I needed a few tabs open in my browser and a book turned to
a certain page. I made a special space for these items, and I never closed them.
For a year, they were always ready to go, and when I needed to study it was easy
to just walk to the office and get started.</p>
<p><strong>Commit to just 5 minutes (but do a lot of them!)</strong></p>
<p>That being said, there are just times when you're worn out. Aside from times
when you should take an actual break from work and be kind to yourself, sometimes
all you need is to just get started. Try committing to just 5 minutes, and here's
the key part: if all you do is 5 minutes, you have to be ok with it. Consider
yourself tired and accept the success, albeit small, from having completed the
mini-goal you set out for yourself. A lot of the time, you'll just need to get
started, and you'll be good to go.</p>
<p>If all you've got is those five minutes, that's fine. Now try taking the rest of
 the hour off, and then come back to it at the beginning of the next hour. Over
 a 12-hour period, you've covered an hour of reading while only taking on 5-minute
 segments. </p>
<p>You could then move on to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>),
or try a mixture of both. The point is that you're making progress even if it's
not all the way. Yes, you're probably losing some time in the context switching,
but prioritize the second to just getting through the material.</p>
<p><strong>Start as early as possible</strong></p>
<p>Here's the one you've been dreading. There's no secret: if you've got to knock
out a 600-page book, it's going to be way easier to do it in 10-page chunks than
300-page ones.</p>
<p>I don't have a math or computer science background, so studying computer science
and technical interview concepts was very difficult for me, so what did I do?
Followed the above techniques and set aside 90 minutes a day 5 days a week for a
year. Spreading out the studying, ala Make It Stick's
description of spaced repetition made the learning deeper, and I never felt like
I was cramming. </p>
<p><strong>Make a tiny habit out of just starting</strong> </p>
<p>I ran a 50K a few months ago. It was tough and filled with 17-minute miles, but
I'm happy to say that I completed it. That being said, I was <strong>done</strong> with
running for the immediate future after it was finished. So, I decided to start
a tiny habit. I'd been introduced to B.J. Fogg's work in 2015, and it'd worked
wonders for me, so I decided to give it a shot again. My only goal was to get
dressed, shoes and all, to go running. That was it. So, for 2 weeks straight,
that was all I did: get dressed, dread the thought of running, and then go back
upstairs and change into my street clothes. What he hints at in the book is that
as that action becomes easier, it takes less mental space. When it takes less
mental space, you can do more in that time. It took a couple of months, but now
I'm back up to 25-30 miles/week. Like just committing to 5 minutes, the key is
to be kind to yourself and just keep the habit going. You have to be ok with
the tiny habit. In my case, just getting dressed. There were times when I was
going out for a 5-miles run, hated the way I felt, and still patted myself on the
back having only accomplished 1 block. The goal hadn't changed: get dressed.

<p><strong>Be kind to yourself</strong></p>
<p>If you fall off the wagon, just get back on. It's ok. Pretend that a friend
asked for your advice about your situation. Be you own best friend. What would
you say to yourself? It's probably not mean, so be kind to yourself.</p>
