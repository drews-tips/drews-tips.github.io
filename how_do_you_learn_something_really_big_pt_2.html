<p>How Do You Learn Something Really Big? (Part 2)</p>
<p>After putting together the large framework and some basic rules, I jump to the
specifics of the actual time-boxing and goal-setting via <em>59 Seconds</em>. Here's
how it works (again, I modify to suit my needs):</p>
<ol>
<li>Name your goal. What is it you want to be able to do? This is the same as
in <em>Ultralearning</em> (get a job at a top-tier tech company, ace my final exam,
win the audition, etc.).</li>
<li>Break the goal down into no more than 5 concrete steps using the following
framework:<ul>
<li>How do you define "done" for this sub-goal?</li>
<li>What are the steps you've taken to ensure its success? (Scheduled time in calendar, secured a teacher, etc.)</li>
<li>How much time will you give this sub-goal?</li>
<li>The final step in the book is to offer yourself a reward, but I've never found
this a useful incentive. The goal is its own reward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I add a retrospective step to gather feedback from outside sources, which
could include referencing a lesson in a book to see if I followed a procedure
correctly or asking a reliable third party for feedback.</li>
<li>Incorporate feedback into the next sub-goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>The author also recommends listing the benefits from having achieved the goal
and doing what he calls "going public." I've tried both of these steps several
times, but I haven't found them effective motivators. I skip them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Worksheet</p>
<ol>
<li>Define "done" for your goal</li>
<li>Choose 3-5 sub-goals. For each, do the following:<ol>
<li>Define "done" for this sub-goal</li>
<li>List steps you've taken to achieve success (scheduled time, etc.)</li>
<li>How long are you going to work on this sub-goal? </li>
<li>Receive feedback on this sub-goal</li>
<li>Incorporate feedback into next goal</li>
</ol>
