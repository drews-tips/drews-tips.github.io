<ul>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked=""> Goals</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked=""> Gathered materials</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked=""> Discovered how others have achieved the goal</li>

<p>We'll cover the final 2 together:</p>
<ol>
<li>What's your goal?</li>
<li>What materials are you going to use to achieve that goal?</li>
<li>How have others achieved this goal?</li>
<li>How best can you simulate part (or all) of what you want to be able to do?</li>
<li>How much time and how often are you going to work on achieving this goal?</li>
<li><strong>How will you receive feedback?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How will you incorporate feedback into your work?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Final stretch!</p>
<p>Feedback comes in all forms, and it doesn't have to come from another person.
If you're studying for a big test, you might have answers in the back of the
book that hopefully come with explanations.</p>
<p>Here are the sources of feedback, ranked from good to bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master familiar with your work</li>
<li>Master not familiar with your work or someone pretty good who's familiar with your work</li>
<li>Someone pretty good who's not familiar with your work</li>
<li>General audience</li>
<li>Non-human source that's awesome</li>
<li>Non-human source that's ok</li>
<li>Public speaker</li>
<li>Non-human source that's bad</li>
</ul>
<p>That list reveals 2 large categories: human and non-human with varying degrees
of success. I'll talk about why I've organized the list this way and what it
potentially means.</p>
<p><strong>Master familiar with your work</strong></p>
<p>Think of every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">hero's journey</a> story out there: Star Wars, Harry Potter,
Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Lord of the Rings, etc. The master knows exactly
what's wrong with the subject and can help him/her improve. This is built-in in
music: we have private lessons almost from day 1. (Tech doesn't really do this,
which surprised me. I think it's opportunity-cost driven in that senior devs
need to be writing code and not focusing a bulk of their time on actually teaching.)
The master knows where you're weak and knows how to help you get better.</p>
<p><strong>Master not familiar with your work or someone pretty good who's familiar with your work</strong></p>
<p>This would be like going to a music conference and taking a one-time masterclass
with a pro. S/He can point out the biggest flaws and maybe a method of overcoming
them but has no idea of anything deeper. On the business side, image asking for
a review of your work from someone really good but from another department that
you don't work with all the time.</p>
<p>Balancing out this one are the people that are pretty good but that you see all
the time. Think "master minus," that is, still good, but not as good.</p>
<h3 id="the-above-are-the-ideal-solutions-but-most-of-us-have-to-deal-with-these-down-here">The above are the ideal solutions, but most of us have to deal with these down here</h3>
<p><strong>Someone pretty good who's not familiar with your work</strong></p>
<p>These are the people that most of use work with all the time. They were in our
training class when we started our new job or our first classes together in
school. They're valuable resources, but they aren't going to be as effective as
those above. The bonus is that they're usually free. All those above usually cost
a ton to work with.</p>
<p><strong>General audience</strong></p>
<p>This is what I call blind feedback. No one's going to give you any direct words
to improve, but you're going to learn from the experience. Examples are practicing
your recital materials in front of a group of middle-school students. You'll
get a feel for when they're bored really fast, and maybe that means you need to
change something up.</p>
<p>It could also be an annual performance review from your boss's boss's boss. That
person has no clue about your work specifically but knows the general effect
you're having on your team and the office in total.</p>
<p>These are valuable for the overall impression you're giving, but offer zero
literal advice.</p>
<p><strong>Non-human source that's awesome</strong></p>
<p>The best feedback is specific and actionable. By the time you get back to your
desk, you know exactly what you're going to do differently. When you get away
from humans, it's pretty tough to figure that out.</p>
<p>Feedback in this category comes from celebrated tomes in your industry.
<em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em> for tech interviewing, <em>Clean Code</em> for writing
code, <em>48 Studies</em> by Ferling if you're an oboist or saxophonist, <em>Patterns for
Jazz</em> if you're diving into improvisation. Whatever the biggie is for your field,
that's the best way to determine what you <em>should</em> be able to do. But it's not
going to tell you how, just <em>what</em>.</p>
<h3 id="now-were-getting-into-the-categories-to-avoid">Now we're getting into the categories to avoid</h3>
<p><strong>Non-human source that's ok</strong></p>
<p>These are pamphlets written by ok teachers and books with rigid rules that don't
understand any kind of nuance or subtlety. Most personality tests and book centered around
them fall into this category (think Myers-Briggs). Avoid.</p>
<p><strong>Public speaker</strong></p>
<p>This is perhaps the most-pernicious of them all. These are the people who offer
nothing by vague platitudes: "Follow your passion" is probably the most-damaging
of them all. I, for example, followed my passion to be <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bleeding_Gums_Murphy">Beeding Gums Murphy</a>
until I was almost 30 years old.</p>
<ul>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked=""> Follow passion</li>
</ul>
<p>But following my passion left me completely closed to other things I might have
enjoyed: like computer science, economics, and psychology. I loved studying those,
but I mostly ignored them, because I was so passion driven. That was a mistake.
You know what would've been some good advice, that's <em>waaaaaay</em> less sexy than
"follow your passion"? Pretty much everything in Cal Newport's <em>So Good They Can't
Ignore You</em>.</p>
<p>The problem with public speakers is that they give what I call "lazy advice."
It's easy to tell a crowd to "work hard," but what does that really mean? If we
plugged "work hard" into a SMART goal-setting system, it doesn't meet <em>any</em> of
the criteria for a good goal. But, it's very easy to say.</p>
<p><strong>Non-human source that's bad</strong></p>
<p>Don't follow bad books.</p>
<h3 id="so-how-does-all-this-matter-to-my-case-study-goal-of-learning-a-new-codebase">So, how does all this matter to my case-study goal of learning a new codebase?</h3>
<p>It helps me guide my thinking on where I want to get feedback from. Starting from
the bottom, I probably should avoid advice from developers worse than I am and
inspiring speeches about the "beauty of code." They probably aren't bad or
intended to be harmful, but they have a much lower chance of actually being helpful.</p>
<p>Can I find an expert familiar with my work? Not yet. I'm too new to the team and
the company. Given that software development is largely an oral tradition, I think
that'll come along once I get more time in my new space.</p>
<p>Getting a master or someone pretty good to look at my work is probably what's
going to happen for a while. That's perfect. I'll be able to learn a ton from
people like that.</p>
<p>I'll also submit my work to a pool of developers (General Audience) to see what
they think of it as a whole. They'll toss out random bits of help that will
guide me to fitting in and then being able to reach out to others for more help.</p>
<p>In this new situation, I'm generally going to avoid reading a really good book,
in place of getting actual feedback. That may sound contradictory <em>But Drew, why
would you ever want to ignore advice from a proven source of information?</em></p>
<p>Because there's an opportunity cost to spending time reading <em>Clean Code</em> versus
actually writing code in a new system. Given my north star: 1-3 tasks completed
each week for my first 4 weeks on the team, ramping up my <em>Clean Code</em> skills is
not the <em>best</em> step forward, albeit still a good one.</p>
<p>My feedback plans are also driven by my north star, so I should be good to go.</p>
<p>... and if not, that's ok; I'll course-correct as soon as I find out :)</p>
