<p>I've got a ton of code to learn working at Facebook if I want to be an effective
and efficient team member. More so, I'd like to be able
to help out on other teams, unblock myself, and be a resource for others sooner
rather than later. That kicks off the question: "What can I do to learn this new
codebase efficiently and effectively?" So, I figured this was a good opportunity
to start a new learning project. I'll be using my own tools on this blog and walking
through how I apply the steps I've laid out in other posts. And! I'll link to those
posts so that you know what's going on :)</p>
<p>Here's the worksheet:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What's your goal?</strong></li>
<li>What materials are you going to use to achieve that goal?</li>
<li>How have others achieved this goal?</li>
<li>How best can you simulate part (or all) of what you want to be able to do?</li>
<li>How much time and how often are you going to work on achieving this goal?</li>
<li>How will you receive feedback?</li>
<li>How will you incorporate feedback into your work?</li>
</ol>
<p>The very first step is to realize that what I want to do is a learning goal.
Let's start at the beginning with worksheet 1 from "<a href="how_do_you_learn_something_really_big_pt_1.html">How Do You Learn Something Really Big? (Part 1)</a>", which begins with listing goals.
I've hinted at them above:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be an effective and efficient team member</li>
<li>Be able to help other teams</li>
<li>Be able to unblock myself when I get stuck</li>
<li>Be a resource for team members as soon as possible</li>
</ol>
<p>To clarify further, I need to define each of those goals. I like to use the
SMART framework with a couple of slight modifications.</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>pecific -- Define "done" for your goal. That's the only way you'll know if
you've achieved it, right? "Run 3 times a week for a month"
is much better than "run more often."<br><strong>M</strong>easurable -- You should be able to see if you're making progress. Given
the above running example, how would you know if you're getting closer to your
goal? Taking 1 step is technically "more often" but accomplishing an actual
running activity counts toward your 3 for the week.<br><strong>A</strong>chievable -- Is this realistic? "Break the world record for the marathon"
is nice and ambitious, but you might be setting yourself up for failure.
Something that big would need to be broken down into lots of sub-goals. If your
goal is that big, awesome. But, there's a time constraint, which we'll get to
soon.
<br><strong>R</strong>elevant -- Is it the right moment for this goal? If I've just broken my leg,
aiming to run 3 times a week probably isn't going to work out.<br><strong>T</strong>ime bound -- What's a reasonable amount of time to accomplish this goal?
Here's a little framework I like to use from Sean Young's <em>Stick With It</em>. The
author breaks down goals into different time boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dreams</strong>: 3+ months</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Goals</strong>: 1-3 months</li>
<li><strong>Short-Term Goals</strong>: 1 week - 1 month</li>
<li><strong>Steps</strong>: less than 1 week</li>
</ul>
<p>Dreams will probably take longer to achieve, but the point is that
all dreams are just a series of steps and short- and long-term goals. If you
have a dream that's going to take longer than 3 months, that's great! Break it
down into short- and long-term goals and steps, and you'll be on your way.</p>
<p>So you can see that my goals for this learning project aren't that great :(  </p>
<p>Let's take them apart.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be an effective and efficient team member -- I don't think this one meets any
of the SMART steps above. Let's figure this out. What does it mean to be effective
and efficient? Well, effective means that I can solve problems, and efficient
means that I can do it quickly. I want to focus on the "solve problems"
and "quickly" parts. How would I define those? Solving problems while being new
on a team means that I should probably be fixing bugs. Ok, check; makes sense.
How many sounds reasonable? 1-3 week for a month, just off the top of my head sounds fine.
That also solves the issue of efficiency because that number can be managed:
is it enough? Is doing more eating into my work/life balance? Using that benchmark
sounds like a reasonable starting point. So, let's update the goal.</li>
</ol>
<p><del>Be an effective and efficient team member</del> --&gt; Complete 1-3 tasks/week for the first 30 days.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Be able to help other teams -- Fortunately, the best way I can be of service
is through knowing my stuff, and we've defined that I can get there best by
completing tasks. We can cross this one off the list.</li>
</ol>
<p><del>Be able to help other teams</del></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Be able to unblock myself when I get stuck -- I've covered this one in my post
on getting <a href="feel_the_fear_and_do_it_anyway.html">stuck</a>. Suffice it to say that completing more tasks will help me
with this combined with getting out of holes when I'm stuck. The basic idea is
to ask for help sooner rather than later. Let's amend this one.</li>
</ol>
<p><del>Be able to unblock myself when I get stuck</del> --&gt; Ask for help sooner rather than later</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Be a resource for team members as soon as possible -- This one is mostly
covered by the first one. The more I know and the more I've contributed, the
better I'll be able to help others. However, there are other aspects that I need
to have under my belt to help most. Solving problems is usually a bottom-up way
of understanding something, but I'll also need a top-down understanding. I can
get that by asking those that have been around on the team for a while, and I can
break that into tasks that I can take apart too. So, this goal becomes more about
having meetings and trying to understand the big picture of the project. The
goal now looks like this:</li>
</ol>
<p><del>Be a resource for team members as soon as possible</del> --&gt; Schedule meetings
with existing team members to get a high-level understanding of the architecture
and design of the system within the next week</p>
<p>Alright, so now our goals are much stronger:</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete 1-3 tasks/week for the first 30 days.</li>
<li>Ask for help sooner rather than later (more of a rule than a goal, but that's ok!)</li>
<li>Schedule meetings
with existing team members to get a high-level understanding of the architecture
and design of the system within the next week.</li>
</ol>
