<ul>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked=""> Goals</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked=""> Materials and techniques others have used</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's tackle the next step:</p>
<ol>
<li>What's your goal?</li>
<li>What materials are you going to use to achieve that goal?</li>
<li>How have others achieved this goal?</li>
<li><strong>How best can you simulate part (or all) of what you want to be able to do?</strong></li>
<li>How much time and how often are you going to work on achieving this goal?</li>
<li>How will you receive feedback?</li>
<li>How will you incorporate feedback into your work?</li>
</ol>
<p>My ideas here are augmented by <em>Ultralearning</em>.</p>
<p>Whenever I'm asked to give feedback on a performance (public speaking, technical
  interview, clarinet recital), I always want to know how the performer felt
  about things. These responses fall into two broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I was better in the practice room/study/office"</li>
<li>"I nailed it"</li>
</ul>
<p>Yep, just those two. I know that sounds weird, but I think it speaks to the
performer's level of preparation, the most important part of which is simulating
the performance environment. I'll lay out some examples from a handful of my
pursuits to illustrate.</p>
<p><strong>Music (kind of)</strong></p>
<p>I took my qualifying exams in the fall of 2015. These were the tests that I had
to pass to fulfill my doctorate. At the beginning of the doctoral program, one
of the professors said that the summer prior to attempting the exam should be
reserved solely for study. I took him at his word, and that was what I did that
summer. One of techniques I used constantly was from another Cal Newport book,
<em>How To Become a Straight-A Student</em>. The book is filled with gems, but the
one that served me best then was to anticipate what questions might be asked. So
I spent the summer guessing at questions and trying to come up with essay topics,
technical questions, and musicological arguments. Given a berth of prompts,
discussion topics, and technical questions, I geared all of my preparation
toward those questions that acted as simulations of the real thing. I'd also
set a timer for three hours, and I wrote full-blown essays and analyses that
I was able to critique later and improve upon.</p>
<p>It worked great.</p>
<p>On the day of the exam, I'd basically already completed the questions already,
having guessed pretty closely to the actual prompts, and I was able to render
10 pages of examples, arguments, and analyses in the 3-hour span. I felt great
afterward!</p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong></p>
<p>You can't always get an actual mock audition or interview. They take a lot out
of the interviewer, so they're tough to come by. I'm fortunate that my brilliant
wife is an engineer at Google, so I was able to get a ton of help from her. Once
a week, she'd flip to a random page on Leetcode.com or something in</p>
<p><em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em> and give me a mock interview. I'd get stuck,
and she helped me learn why and where to ask for help. And, I did absolutely
everything on a whiteboard, which is common practice for technical interviews,
attempting to make the situation as close to the real deal as possible.</p>
<p>When I got to my interviews at Facebook, nothing was new. I'd done tons of mock
interviews with my wife, and I felt prepared and confident throughout. Another
success.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about some failures.</p>
<p><strong>Music (again)</strong></p>
<p>He teaches at Yale, and when I decided I wanted to pursue the clarinet as a
career, it made sense that I'd apply to Yale to study with David Shifrin. I
practiced for years, got tons of lessons, and followed my teachers' notes and
recommendations exactly. When the time came to submit pre-screening (Yale gets
  a ton of applications, so they listen to preliminary recordings to eliminate
  people), I didn't even get passed the first round. I was devastated. Being
  able to look back, I know exactly what I did wrong.</p>
<p>It's common parlance to record yourself as a musician. How else can you review
your performances and catch errors. It's certainly too tough to do on stage.
Here's the thing: I never recorded myself. It was just a laziness thing -- I
didn't want to spend the time to set up the mic and then listen back and take
notes on what I could do better. But, what does recording do? It puts the gun
to your head: you have to perform right there, you've only got 1 shot,
and it's being documented. It
doesn't get your heart rate up like a live performance does, but it moves in that
direction. If I had to do it again, I'd record myself approximately 50 times/day,
like I was doing near the end of my career.</p>
<p>Listening back on that old pre-screening recording I sent to Yale (the <strong>only</strong>
  recording I made of myself), it's no wonder they didn't take me. I don't blame
  them one bit.</p>
<p><strong>Tech (again)</strong></p>
<p>I interviewed at Google at the beginning of 2019. Things did not go well. After
giving my experience a retrospective, I could see all the problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd only used one source to study (Interview Cake)</li>
<li>I mistook the actual problem I needed to solve, which was really solving <em>novel</em>
problems, not having a library of questions in my head that I could use as models
to solve unseen problems.</li>
<li>I was too afraid to do mock interviews -- terrified in fact of someone revealing
that I wasn't good enough before I had even walked through the door</li>
<li>I followed instructions too literally from Barbara Oakley's <em>A Mind for
Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)</em>,
instead of using my learning intuition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing all this, I knew exactly what to fix for future interviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get tons of sources. You don't have to use them all, just do jump around.
People discuss things differently, and you want to at least be familiar with
those different discussions before the big day rolls around. It'll save you time,
energy, and a lot of anxiety.</li>
<li>I was basically really good at solving a handful of questions: I could explain
them really well, but I wasn't good at transferring that information to novel
settings. This just takes practice, so the goal became to get good at solving
novel problems, not just building up a toolbox of examples to reference in the
heat of the moment.</li>
<li>I did tons of mock interviews.</li>
<li>I leaned more on my learning intuition. This was an error from my music days
when, in an attempt to follow my instructors exactly, I'd wind off in weird
directions, like when one told me he had everything memorized. So, then for the
next month I was trying to memorize everything I played. He later told me, after
I admitted my struggle doing so, that he was speaking figuratively. Oh...
I did the same thing here, relying on <em>A Mind for Numbers</em> and its chunking
method. That's an awesome method, and it was perfect for getting a strong hold
of data structures, but applying that chunking to every single novel problem
I approached slowed me down drastically. I was covering literally 1/4 the amount
that I needed. So much wasted time. But a great lesson learned!</li>
