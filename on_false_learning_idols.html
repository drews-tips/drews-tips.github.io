<p>Beware the false idols of learning! These are real, and they will slow you down
a ton.</p>
<p>So, what are they?</p>
<p>Let's examine two common learning tools: books and online courses. On the face of it, what's wrong with these? Well, it depends on what your goals are. If you'd like to go through these materials as you would a novel, then you'll take about as much from them. There's nothing wrong with that, but I'd like to propose a mindset that will enable you to squeeze as much out of the sponge as possible.</p>
<p>Set goals for your study. What should you be able to do upon completion of the course or book? Lots of us approach these tools with the implicit understanding that finishing the course or the book means that we've "learned" the material it's covered.</p>
<p>Thinking this way is the equivalent to a "runner" who's only <em>read</em> about running or a "cellist" who has only <em>read</em> about playing the cello. It's just not the same. Now, there's nothing wrong with reading, but I challenge you, if you'd really like to learn from your reading, that you set some goals around it.</p>
<p>There are tons of "90% off Python Bootcamp!"-type courses pitched on LinkedIn all the time. If you're going to take one, fine, but realize that having completed the course does not make you a Python developer. It's a step, but it's only the first one. Now, imagine you'd said that upon completion, you'd be able to create a Django web app or you'd finally be able to use Pandas (a Python tool) to analyze your non-profit's fundraising data. Doing so will guide your education and propel you to find the holes in your understanding.</p>
<p>Just finishing a course won't. But you might get a neat digital certificate.</p>
