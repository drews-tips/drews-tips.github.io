<p>I'm a bad runner. I'm slow, I don't prepare as much as I should, and I'm never
anywhere near the front of the pack. In fact, I think I'm near the end most of
the time. Fortunately, I treat running like others treat golf: I'm just trying
to beat myself, not anyone else. Having that mindset has gotten me through a
handful of very long runs, including about 10 marathons, a 50K, a 50-miler, and
a 100K. There are some nice lessons that I've transferred over from running to
all kinds of study.</p>
<p>Let's start with the premise: I've got a big interview coming up in a month. I
always schedule big, important interviews <em>way</em> out. <span>I do not cram</span>. So, I decide
to put in a study weekend. That is, a weekend where my only goal is to get in
some serious study time.</p>
<p>One of the tenets in Cal Newport's <span><em>Deep Work</em></span> is the grand gesture.
Newport tells a story about how <em>Harry Potter</em> author J.K. Rowling was finding
it difficult to focus at home, so she checked into a hotel where she could work
undisturbed. Getting away from the distractions of everyday life enabled her
to finish the series.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I decide to get an AirBnB nearby to facilitate the weekend
devoted to study. Making the grand gesture adds weight to the amount of focus.
Why would I spend money and time away from my wife just to futz around on the
internet down the street?</p>
<p>Now back to the running. One of the maxims in running is to fuel early and often.
By the time you're feeling out of gas, it's too late. So prepare early. Given
the proper preparation, you can go a really long time without having to stop.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the same foes for studying. Ever been a study zombie? You know the
symptoms: foggy head, slightly dizzy, metal exhaustion, inability to focus.
That feeling has stumped many would-be all-day studiers. What can be done?
Fuel early and often. What does fuel for your brain look like?</p>
<ul>
<li>Rest</li>
<li>The right foods</li>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Intelligent context switching</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rest">Rest</h3>
<p>I'm a big fan of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomordoro Technique</a>. It's
got rest built right in. I extend the long break, and I add an even bigger one
later in the day, and I stand by the effectiveness of the technique.</p>
<h3 id="the-right-foods">The right foods</h3>
<p>There's something about cheese and most meat products that make me feel heavy
and unable to focus, so I save those for celebratory evenings instead of days
where I need to maximize the time I'm spending on work. Trust me: <a href="https://meltbarandgrilled.com/">I would never
turn down some good cheese :)</a>. Experiment with
what foods get your brain going and which ones make you feel like you're thinking
through mud. I read that salmon has a great affect on the brain, but I've never
felt that to be the case (maybe because it's usually cooked in so much
concentration-killing butter?).</p>
<p>Plants are my go-tos here. I have a green smoothie in the morning,
eat as many apples/pears/grapes as I want when I start to get hungry, and have
handfuls of nuts to supplement. Of course I eat real meals too. But on intense
study weekends, I try to keep them light and healthy.</p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
<p>There's something about getting my heart rate up that really frees up my brain.
I can be a study zombie at 2, go for a 30-minute moderate-intensity run, take my
time getting cleaned up, and by 3:15 I'm feeling ready to start up again, about
90% refreshed.</p>
<h3 id="engaging-restorative-activites">Engaging, restorative activites</h3>
<p>Find a restorative activity that relaxes your brain. I find that these types of
activities need to be slightly engaging: play music, read a fiction book, even
take a shower, go for a pretty drive, grab lunch with a friend. I've had zero
success playing video games, watching tv, or just surfing the web. Those seem
to drain more of my energy.</p>
<p>Note: playing music as rest is interesting to me as a former musician. The idea
of setting down my clarinet after 2 hours of intense practice and picking up
another instrument doesn't seem restorative. But, after 2 hours of studying
algorithms and data structures, picking up my bass feels pretty good. I assume
that it has to do with the type of mental gymnastics you do in each field and
that the switching is the important part, not the destination.</p>

<p>Total: 15 pomodoros</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>This schedule will maximize your focus and productivity for as
long as possible. Notice the final total; it's not even 7.5 hours worth of actual
work. You'll actually be doing <em>less</em> using this system, than trying to grind
the night away, unfocused hour after unfocused hour.</p>
<p>This schedule was constructed from experience. I ground away dumb hours for
years as a musician. It took years to realize what I was doing wrong.
I regret not being more intentional in my day-to-day planning. Here's what
those days looked like:</p>
<h2 id="schedule-for-not-maximizing-productivity">Schedule for <strong>not</strong> maximizing productivity</h2>
<p>7:00 - 8:00 -- Wake up and get ready<br>8:00 - 10:00 -- Grind away. No breaks<br>10:00 - 10:30 -- Break<br>10:30 - 12:30 -- 2 more hours of work<br>12:30 - 2:00 -- Lunch<br>2:00 - 4:00 -- 2 more hours<br>4:00 - 4:30 -- Break<br>4:30 - 6:30 -- 2 more hours</p>
<p>Can you see the problems? The breaks are arbitrary. They are just after 2 hours
of work. They aren't intended to maximize focus. They're just when the clock
strikes. Contrast that with the maximized schedule. Tons of breaks.</p>
<p>Using running again, imagine sprinting for as long as you can. You'll be tired,
and then you'll take a break. The next time you go to sprint, you won't make it
as far. As the day wears on, your sprints will get shorter and shorter until
you're just shuffling along. Physically shuffling along is the same as being a
study zombie. It's a little hard to tell because you aren't breathing heavily
and your heart rate will only be slightly elevated, but you're shuffling, and
you're not making progress. You might even mentally stumble and start doing the
wrong things, essentially walking backward.</p>
<p>One last analogy: I did a pushup challenge a few months ago. The idea was to do
as many pushups in the day as possible. Given these schedules, how you would go
about that? I'll tell you what I did. I did 10 pushups every half-hour, and since
they were so spread out, I was able to maintain that pace for the entire day. It
would've been embarrassing to do them in a meeting, so I missed a couple
of sessions in there, but I counted 300 pushups at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I can imagine just grinding them out in front of the TV after dinner for a couple
of hours, but that doesn't sound like fun.</p>
<p>And it's just not sustainable.</p>
