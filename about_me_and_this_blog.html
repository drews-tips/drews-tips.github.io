<p>About Me and This Blog</p>
<p>I'm Drew Sullivan, and I'm currently a software engineer at Facebook. In a past life, I was a professional clarinetist where I substituted with the Cleveland Orchestra among others, received my Doctor of Musical Arts from the Cleveland Institute of Music, and taught at Notre Dame College in Cleveland as an adjunct professor of music history, theory, and clarinet.</p>
<p>The point of this blog is get some of my learning ideas down in writing. I've had many requests over the years to put down in words the steps I've taken to go from being accepted to an elite conservatory's doctoral program, passing doctoral qualifying exams, learning to code, and eventually being hired by a top shop in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The next time I embark on a new learning project, I want all of the materials in one place and explained clearly.</p>
<p>The blog is meant to have all of those insights in one place. It's meant for me, but maybe it'll help you too.</p>
