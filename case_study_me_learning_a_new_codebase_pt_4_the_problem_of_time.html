<p>I think this one will be a little shorter!</p>
<p>When I was a musician, I didn't practice efficiently. It pains me to look back
and see the inefficiencies and wasted time. Parts of my life just gone. But! I
learned a ton about efficiency along the way.</p>
<p>In the summers of 2008 and 2009, I practiced music about 40 hours/week. I had
read that my favorite jazz artists, Charlie Parker and John Coltrane, had done
something similar, so that seemed like the key to success -- put in the time and
 the good work; the rest will follow.</p>
<p> Sure, I had a good amount of success as a musician, but I could have had it for
 a lot less. Here's what I would tell my 2008 and 2009 self.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Time doesn't matter -- only completing the goal does. Unfortunately, my goal
was to just accumulate a ton of hours. Yipee. As discussed
<a href="case_study_me_learning_a_new_codebase_pt_1_intro_and_goals.html">here</a>, a goal is
your north star. My north star was wrong.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't look for perfection; look for improvement -- I'm a perfectionist, so
this would be really hard for my 2008/9 self to take. <em>But how can I compete
against people who do it more perfectly than I do?</em> I'd think. That was the
wrong mindset. Instead, getting better should've been good enough. Despite all
the time investment, I was very impatient, and I wanted something to be perfect
as soon as possible. I'd spend weeks and months on tiny fractions of the music,
but I should've been satisfied with my progress, timeboxed the whole thing, and
came back to it in the future. Here's the takeaway: your learning is going to
come in waves. There are things you need and want to be able to do right now
that you're just not going to be able to do. Get away from it, allow it to
mature, and let that myelin grow! When you come back, it'll be better, and you
won't have been working on it.</p>
<p>(Fun note: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin">myelin</a> was introduced to me in Daniel
Coyle's <em>The Talent Code: Unlocking the Secret of Skill in Sports, Art, Music,
Math, and Just About Everything Else</em>. That book was a great narrative of
stories about skill improvement, and his follow-up <em>The Little Book of Talent:
52 Tips for Improving Your Skills</em> is a masterclass of extremely-valuable
tips that I come back to all the time. More posts on those later!)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get out and smell the roses -- my teacher, Jim, used to say that I practiced
too much. Looking back at all those years spent alone in a room, he was right.
I should've gotten out more. In fact, in Mason Currey's <em>Daily Rituals: How
Artists Work</em>, I noticed a huge pattern: almost all of the creatives had big
social lives. They'd basically knock out their work in the mornings or early
afternoons and then go hang out the rest of the day. That's a big simplification,
but that's the big takeaway. You can be great without dumping away tons of time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> For my specific case-study goal, I need to choose an arbitrary amount of time.
 That's ok! The point is to iterate quickly and learn from mistakes.
 I'm flexible: if it's too little, I'll make it longer for next time. So, I'm
 choosing 4 work weeks. I'll re-evaluate after then.</p>
<p>If I had the chance to talk to my younger self, I say this:
Be like a firefighter. When was the
last time you heard about a firefighter hanging out in a burning building just
to meet some kind of time quota? Get in, do what you need to, and get out.</p>
