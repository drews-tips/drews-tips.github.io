<p>I'm afraid of looking dumb. I've been that way forever. We're in the middle of
Covid-19 right now, and I've started my new job at Facebook remotely. This is
not ideal. I'm a big fan of being able to turn to the person next to me and ask
2-minute questions. I'm <em>not</em> a fan of having to schedule video calls and screen
shares when asking someone to pull up a chair next to me was so much more effective.</p>
<p>Plus, there's the added worry of finally getting on the call with someone generous
enough to help out, and then I can't remember everything s/he told me, and then
I have to ask all over again. I think part of what I feel is irrational, but
it's how I feel.</p>
<p>Years ago, I read Susan Jeffers's <em>Feel the Fear... and Do It Anyway</em>. At the time,
I was terrified of looking dumb on stage. I was a musician in the throws of my
doctorate, and all the great scholars and musicians around me were super intimidating.
But, Dr. Jeffers's book really helped me ground myself. Inspired by the title alone
(what's <em>in</em> the book is even better), I started acknowledging the fear... and
then diving in.</p>
<p>I ended up getting a ton of great feedback, upping my game, and even getting a
date along the way (I was equally terrified to ask a girl I was interested in out).
The author talks about numerous ways to get over the fear or learn to deal with it.
Here's how I've adapted her words to my current situation.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the self-talk I experience. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I should know how to solve this kind of problem</li>
<li>They’ve found me out</li>
<li>Find an avenue, then I can figure it out</li>
<li>Fear that I can’t solve this type of problem</li>
<li>He’s going to think I’m dumb</li>
<li>He’ll tell the manager that I need too much help</li>
<li>I won’t ever get promoted</li>
<li>I might be fired for not being good enough</li>
<li>I’m not independent enough</li>
<li>I’ll get a negative review at the end of the half</li>
<li>That my skill level is too low for the company</li>
<li>I shouldn’t need hand-holding at all</li>
<li>I’m afraid I’m bothering someone and taking them away from his/her work</li>
<li>People will think I’m stupid</li>
<li>How’d he get here?</li>
<li>Why is it taking her so long?</li>
<li>Afraid to ask something dumb</li>
<li>Afraid what the helper will say</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I pretend that I'm the one being asked for help. What would I think of the person asking?:</p>
<ul>
<li>This system is really complex. It’s not a problem that he needs help getting used to things</li>
<li>Didn’t I just talk to him? Oh well, this won’t take long</li>
<li>Yeah, no problem</li>
<li>Sure, give me a few minutes, then I’ll help out</li>
<li>He put in a good effort. He’s figuring it out. It’s just new. No worries</li>
<li>He’s not bad. He’s just new. He needs more hand-holding right now</li>
<li>Worst-case scenario: I’m just kind of busy</li>
<li>I’ve never thought: “That’s dumb”</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I pretend I'm the manager in this situation. What would I think?:</p>
<ul>
<li>He’s getting ramped up. No problem</li>
<li>He’s getting used to the codebase. No problem</li>
<li>It’s totally expected that he needs this time to get used to everything. It’s really no problem</li>
<li>Talk to me in 6 months if he really needs the basics. 6 months</li>
<li>Way more worried about someone not asking questions, than someone asking too many</li>
<li>Way easier to manage someone who asks too much than who is too shy to ask at all</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I think of "If-Then"s for getting past being afraid to ask for help:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I’m totally lost on how to understand a task, then I will immediately ask for help</li>
<li>If I’m beyond the set-up phase of a task and it’s been 30 minutes of no productivity, then I will write out what I’ve done in the next 30 minutes and ask for help</li>
<li>If I just asked for help or got off a VC but still need help, then I will ask immediately</li>
<li>If I’m embarrassed to ask for help, then it’s time to ask for help</li>
<li>If I feel like I’m going around in circles, then I will immediately ask for help</li>
</ul>
<p>I lay the ground work by establishing some general rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before setting up, I will ask for a video call if I need clarification on a task</li>
<li>During set up, I get 30 minutes to set up. If I’m stuck, I’ll immediately ask for help</li>
<li>After setup, I get 30 minutes to work and 30 minutes to explain what I’ve done. Then I ask for help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I brainstorm how I'd <em>like</em> to feel when I'm stuck?</p>
<ul>
<li>Like it’s just no big deal and no one is judging me for asking questions</li>
<li>Tranquil</li>
<li>Excited to ask for help because it means that I’ll have the next piece of the puzzle</li>
<li>That I’m awesome to work with, so people are excited that I’m asking for help</li>
<li>Like asking for help will have no repercussions</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I pretend that a friend asked me for advice on the topic. What would I say?:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one is keeping tabs on you. They just want to help you do your best</li>
<li>We’ve all been in situations like this, so just dive in and ask for help</li>
<li>Do you think that going around in circles will reveal the answer? (psst. it won’t)</li>
<li>Everyone has to ask for help. Is no big deal</li>
<li>You’re afraid of asking for help? Why? I’d be happy to help you</li>
<li>You wouldn’t be bothering me. I like helping people</li>
<li>I like solving problems, so I’d be happy to help</li>
<li>It’s a little ego boost when someone treats me like the answer man, so I’m happy to show off my knowledge</li>
<li>I’d rather you ask too many questions and move fast than try to solve everything yourself and take forever</li>
<li>I never mind walking anyone through anything</li>
<li>I never mind offering help on basics. We all know different things</li>
<li>You made it over the hiring bar, so I know you’re good. We just need to ramp you up</li>
<li>I like helping you be more productive</li>
<li>You’re going to give me credit for helping you, right? ;)</li>
<li>I need to help people to be able to get a raise. I want to help you</li>
<li>The people on your team just want you to be successful</li>
<li>Your team doesn’t want you to be afraid. They want to help you</li>
<li>You’re about to learn something -- getting stuck is the key to learning</li>
<li>Feel the fear and do it anyway</li>
<li>There’s no benefit from judging yourself</li>
<li>View the situation as neither good nor bad. Just observe and objectively decide what to do next. - No judgement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I found it useful to have excuses or lines ready to go, so that I could eliminate the step of having to come up with one when I'm already stressed for getting stuck in the first place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I’m just not quite understanding here. Here’s what I’ve tried…</li>
<li>I cry uncle!</li>
<li>Sorry to say it, but I’m going to need a little more hand-holding on this one</li>
<li>Alright, would you mind dumbing this down for me?</li>
<li>Maybe this is a bit above my current pay-grade. Would you mind walking me through it?</li>
<li>I’m seeing how this part works, but I’m stuck on how to…</li>
<li>Will you help me get more of a mental model for this?</li>
<li>I’m getting stuck on x. Got a few minutes?</li>
<li>To get my bearings, would you mind if we paired on this for a bit?</li>
<li>I’m totally lost! Just kidding, would you mind pointing me in the right direction?</li>
<li>It’s been a while since I’ve done this kind of thing. Would you mind helping me out?</li>
<li>I’m a little overwhelmed by the size of the system. Would you mind helping me out, please?</li>
<li>I thought I got it, but I didn’t. I know A, B, and I’m fuzzy on C</li>
<li>Let me tell you what I’ve got so far and where I’m stumbling</li>
<li>Can you help me understand the system by walking me through generally how things work with this specific problem</li>
<li>Hey, I want to knock things out as soon as possible, so would you mind…</li>
<li>Sorry! Thought I understood, but what about...</li>
</ul>
