1. "Stress + rest = growth"
2. "Fatigue on one task spills over into the next, even if the two are
completely unrelated"
3. "Fail Productively"

We all experience boundaries, walls that feel insurmountable. The first time I
was rejected for a job at a leading tech company and my wife powered her way
into one, I thought I was done; I thought getting a job like her wasn't something
I would be able to do. These are the types of feelings the authors hint at, and
the opening chapters of their book point to a series of solutions that can help
you get over those walls.

**Stress + Rest = Growth**

To sustain successful training of any kind, the authors implore us to rest after
stressful outings. Those outings can be from
physical or mental undertakings, and the work needs to be balanced with the right
amount of rest. They quote Stephen Seiler, Professor of Sport Science at the
University of Agder:

> Seiler tracked the training of elite athletes across a variety of endurance
sports including running, skiing, swimming, and cycling. He found that,
irrespective of sport or nationality, [the athlete's] training followed roughly the same
distribution. The best athletes in the world ... were systematically alternating
between bouts of very intense work and periods of easy training and recovery,
even if that meant walking up hills.

So what does that mean for us? Do the work and then take a break. And take a
real break. And! Don't feel guilty about taking that break, either. In the
Summers of 2008 and 2009, I was practicing the clarinet all the time. If the
authors would've seen what I was doing, they would have laughed. Sure, I was
knocking out 8-12-hour days, but I never rested. I was even experimenting with
techniques for sleeping less (none of them worked), and I ended up wasting a ton
of time.

Given what the authors propose, I would cut my practice time in half (literally)
and rest so that I was prepared for another day. I always took Sundays off, but
I would increase that when needed. The big takeaway from "stress + rest = growth"
is to put in _good_ time and then rest up so that you can put in good time again.
I ground myself into dust as a musician, and I had good days here and there, but
I could've sustained it had I taken more and longer breaks.

After you've sprinted, what's your "walking up hill"?

**Fatigue on one task spills over into the next, even if the two are
completely unrelated**

Next, prioritize ruthlessly. You've only got so much willpower to work with, and
you don't want to spend it on something that doesn't help you meet your goals.
We've heard this one before, but the authors dig
into it a little more by citing research conducted by Willpower expert and
psychology professor Roy Baumeister. In one of his studies, Baumeister split
participants into two groups to test their willpower. He brought cookies into the
room with all the participants, and half were told they could eat the cookies.
The other half had to resist. Then the participants were given an unsolvable
problem. What happened?

> The [non-cookie]-eaters lasted a little over 8 minutes and gave the problem
19 attempts . The cookie-eaters, on the other hand, persisted for over 20
minutes and attempted to solve the problem 33 times.

Long story short, the cookie-eaters didn't have to waste
their willpower trying to resist eating cookies.

How about us? Maybe say "no" next time someone asks for your opinion on a
side-project their working on. Maybe skip that hike if you've got a big run
coming up tomorrow? How about picking up an instrument for fun? That could be
nice, but what might you be giving up. You've only got so much gas in the tank,
after all.

For me, I check my email too much, and resisting checking it is draining my
willpower. I'm going to install some blocking software to remove the temptation.

**Fail Productively**

Tech and music overlap in a number of different ways. One of them is how you
interact with those around you. In particular, your colleagues will go crazy if
you ask questions without having done any work. The same goes for your private
teacher in music. You must do the work. You must struggle with what you don't
know. When you've reached your limit, _then_ you ask for help. No sooner. First
because whomever you're asking for help will dislike you for not putting in the
effort, but also because you'll learn more if you struggle, or "fail
productively," as the authors put it.

In fact, they pinpoint a reason for a lack of learning using the example of a
student receiving tutoring:

> Students who were forced to struggle on complex problems before receiving help
from teachers outperformed students who received immediate assistance. The
authors of these studies summarized their findings in a simple yet elegant
statement: skills come from struggle.

I got some general advice when I started at Facebook: if you get stuck for more
than an hour, ask for help. Terrified of looking dumb, for my first few weeks,
I ignored this advice. What happened? I spent 3 days trying to look smart, got
nothing done, and then had to show up with my tail between my legs to ask for
help waaaaaaaay too late.

I should've done what the authors recommended: struggle... and then get help.

So, three big takeaways all geared toward pushing past where you currently are:
1. "Stress + rest = growth" -- do good work, then rest so that you can do good
work again. Grinding yourself into the ground it counterproductive.
2. "Fatigue on one task spills over into the next, even if the two are
completely unrelated" -- Choose your priorities wisely. You've only got so much
gas in the tank.
3. "Fail Productively" -- Find the balance of trying to do it on your own and
asking for help. You'll get more out of the experience if you struggle with the
issue. Just don't struggle for too long.
